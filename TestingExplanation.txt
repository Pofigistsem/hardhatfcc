Unit tests - software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested
    - Test minimal portions of our code (ex: contract) in order to make sure that they work correctly

Staging tests - running our code. Not always neccessary but can be helpful.

Unit tests are done locally
    - local hardhat network
    - forked hardaht 

Staging tests are done on a testnet (LAST STOP!!!)
